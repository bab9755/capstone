    "Okay, here’s a synthesized summary of the advice given by alumni to current students regarding career fairs:\n\n“Career fairs are about building genuine connections, so start by researching attending companies beforehand – understand their mission and recent projects. Approach booths with a confident, yet approachable demeanor; a firm handshake and eye contact are key. Don’t just hand out your resume; initiate conversations by asking about their culture, team dynamics, or recent innovations. Prepare a concise ‘elevator pitch’ highlighting your skills and career goals, tailoring it to each company. Listen attentively to the recruiter's responses and ask intelligent follow-up questions. Collect business cards and, importantly, send a personalized thank-you email within 24 hours referencing a specific point from your conversation. Remember, recruiters are looking for candidates who demonstrate enthusiasm, professionalism, and a clear understanding of the role and the company. Focus on quality interactions over quantity – a few strong connections are far more valuable than dozens of superficial ones.”",
