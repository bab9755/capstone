        "120": "At a career event, small groups of students engage with enthusiastic recruiters while enjoying the aroma of coffee and catered snacks. Recruiters distribute tote bags filled with branded notebooks and pens, and students exit with these bags along with stacks of business cards. A cybersecurity company runs a password cracking challenge on a laptop, and university media crews capture interviews. A data science company showcases a live dashboard indicating fair attendance, while career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops. Groups of friends mark target employers on the event map, while some later decompress on the quad, comparing which companies responded warmly. Recruiters remind students to follow up with personalized emails. A whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews, and a robotics startup attracts attention with a small drone flying above its booth. Healthcare providers present community outreach photos, finance firms offer QR codes for immediate internship applications, and an alumni panel discusses preparation for technical interviews. As the day winds down, interview sign-up sheets fill with names."
