    "Okay, here’s a response synthesizing advice from alumni to current students on navigating a career fair:\n\n“Current students, a career fair isn’t about collecting swag; it’s about genuine connection. Don’t just hand out your resume – research the companies beforehand and identify specific roles you’re interested in. Start conversations with genuine curiosity; ask about their company culture, recent projects, or career paths. Prepare a concise ‘elevator pitch’ summarizing your skills and interests, but be ready to listen more than you talk. Follow up within 24 hours with a personalized email referencing your conversation. Alumni consistently advise focusing on building relationships, not just immediate job applications. They emphasize demonstrating enthusiasm and a proactive approach. Remember, companies want to see someone interested in their organization, not just any job. Finally, be polite and professional – good manners go a long way.”",
