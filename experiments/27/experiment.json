Recruiters from consulting firms attract the greatest attendee interest, while alumni offer advice to current students. Students collect branded tote bags and brochures as they move through the hall. Hundreds of students circulate between the core area, the surrounding exhibit rooms, and the company booths, transitioning as recruiters recruit and students explore opportunities.",
