The aroma of coffee and catered snacks wafts from the lounge, where alumni volunteers provide pep talks. A resume review table sponsored by the engineering society is located near the stage. As the event progresses, students fill out interview sign-up sheets, utilize resume upload kiosks, and share their experiences, and announcement chimes signal the final hour, prompting them to exit with tote bags full of materials."
