    "Current students, listen up! Career fairs aren't about collecting swag; they’re about building genuine connections. First, research the companies attending – know their mission, products, and recent news. Don't just collect business cards; have a concise, one-sentence elevator pitch ready, highlighting your skills and interests. Make eye contact, smile, and actively listen to what recruiters are saying. Prepare thoughtful questions, demonstrating you've done your homework. Follow up within 24-48 hours with a personalized email referencing your conversation. Don't be afraid to talk about your projects and quantify your accomplishments. Finally, be professional – dress appropriately, be polite, and thank the recruiters for their time. A sincere connection is far more valuable than a stack of cards.",
