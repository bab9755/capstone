Students rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall, supported by career counselors assisting them in identifying suitable industries. A whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews, and workshops on networking etiquette take place in an adjoining classroom. An alumni panel discusses strategies for technical interviews, and a startup founder leads a lunchtime pitch session while offering quick pep talks. Nearby, a cybersecurity company conducts a password cracking challenge, and camera crews capture interviews while career center staff log attendance metrics. The dean expresses gratitude to recruiters for their support as the day winds down."
