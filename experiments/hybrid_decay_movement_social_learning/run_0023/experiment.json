        "120": "At a vibrant university career fair held in the polished gym, students lined up outside as event staff scanned registrations and distributed lanyards at the entrance. Inside, numerous colorful booths encircle the space, creating an engaging atmosphere accentuated by the inviting aromas of coffee and catered snacks from the lounge. Attendees interacted with enthusiastic recruiters from various sectors, including consulting, cybersecurity, and finance, while comparing swag items like tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, and phone chargers. Career counselors assisted students in practicing their elevator pitches and emphasized maintaining eye contact, while small groups analyzed recruiters' enthusiasm. A robotics startup captured attention by flying a small drone above its booth, and a cybersecurity company conducted a password-cracking challenge on a laptop. As the event concluded, students signed up for same-day interviews, volunteers gathered leftover brochures, dismantled booths, and friends relaxed outside discussing their experiences."
