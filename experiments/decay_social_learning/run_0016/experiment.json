Workshops on networking etiquette take place in an adjoining classroom, where some students quietly rehearse their pitches. Event staff manage registrations, scan attendees, distribute lanyards, and log attendance metrics on laptops. Various tech companies engage attendees, such as a robotics startup flying a small drone above its booth and a cybersecurity company conducting a password cracking challenge on a laptop. As the event concludes, volunteers stack collapsed booths, gather leftover brochures, and the aroma of coffee and catered snacks wafts from the lounge."

Various tech companies engage attendees, with a robotics startup flying a small drone above its booth and a cybersecurity company conducting a password-cracking challenge on laptops. As the event concludes, announcement chimes signal the final hour, while volunteers stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures, with friends decompressing on the quad, sharing experiences."
