        "120": "The university gym is bustling during a career fair, filled with numerous booths featuring colorful banners on the polished floor. Various companies, including finance firms, healthcare providers displaying community outreach photos, a data science firm with a live dashboard of attendance metrics, and a cybersecurity company conducting a password cracking challenge on a laptop, engage students. Human resources teams take notes on tablets while students hold branded resume folders, some lining up outside the gym before it opens. Concurrently, workshops on networking etiquette are held in an adjoining classroom, where an alumni panel discusses technical interview preparation, and career counselors guide small groups practicing elevator pitches. International students seek advice on visa sponsorship requirements, and as the event nears its conclusion, staff log attendance metrics while a startup founder invites attendees to a lunchtime pitch session. Outside, friends gather on the quad to decompress and share experiences."
