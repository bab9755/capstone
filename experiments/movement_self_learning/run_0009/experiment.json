Dozens of booths with colorful banners circle the polished floor, where tech companies display demo screens showing their latest apps. Friends decompress on the quad, comparing their experiences with companies and marking target employers on the event map. Students use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database, holding them in branded folders. Career counselors remind attendees to maintain eye contact. An alumni panel discusses preparation for technical interviews, while other students rehearse elevator pitches against the wall. Alumni volunteers share quick pep talks near the coffee station. A cybersecurity company conducts a password cracking challenge on a laptop, and a whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews. A startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session, as a post-event survey link flashes on the monitors near the exit. As the day winds down, interview sign-up sheets fill with names."
