The lively atmosphere features polished floors, numerous colorful booths, and the aroma of coffee and catered snacks. Consulting firms stack glossy case study booklets on high tables, while students carry tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, business cards, and resumes, practicing elevator pitches. Event staff manage registrations, scan attendees, and log attendance metrics on tablets while distributing lanyards. A robotics startup captivates attendees with a small flying drone above its booth, and a cybersecurity company conducts a password-cracking challenge. Career counselors advise on maintaining eye contact during introductions, and alumni volunteers provide encouragement near the coffee station. As the event concludes, students sign up for interviews, exit with filled tote bags, and the dean expresses gratitude to the recruiters, while volunteers organize the space and gather leftover materials.",
