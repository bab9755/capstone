Surrounding the polished floor, dozens of booths adorned with colorful banners are present, while some students quietly practice their elevator pitches against the wall. Human resources teams actively jot notes on tablets as students introduce themselves. The dean thanks recruiters for their support of the university, and before the career fair opens, students line up outside the university gym. Additionally, a startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session, and representatives from nonprofits emphasize mission-driven career paths. An aroma of coffee and catered snacks spreads from the lounge, enhancing the atmosphere, and a whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews. A data science company showcases a live dashboard of fair attendance, and healthcare providers display community outreach photos."
