Engagement activities included a password cracking challenge hosted by a cybersecurity company and a demonstration of a flying drone by a robotics startup. Workshops on networking etiquette occurred in an adjoining classroom, complete with glossy case study booklets. As the day concluded, announcement chimes signaled the end, prompting volunteers to stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures, while media crews documented interviews and students filled out sign-up sheets outside on the quad."
