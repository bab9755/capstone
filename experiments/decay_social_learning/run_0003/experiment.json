        "120": "The university gym is hosting a vibrant career fair sponsored by the engineering society, featuring numerous colorful booths with banners encircling a polished floor, including one from a notable robotics startup showcasing a small drone flying overhead. Eager students line up outside for registration, where event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards. Inside, the aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the air as recruiters from various organizations hand out tote bags filled with promotional items such as branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, and phone chargers. Students present their resumes, stored in branded folders, at kiosks to upload them to the fair database via tablets, while career counselors operate a resume review table near the stage. Alumni volunteers provide pep talks on technical interview strategies near the coffee station. As the event nears its conclusion, announcement chimes signal the final hour, prompting attendees to depart with their tote bags and business cards."
