Inside, career counselors guide uncertain students toward applicable industries, while representatives from nonprofits highlight mission-driven career paths. Tech companies display demo screens showing their latest apps. Students clutch resumes inside branded folders, and human resources teams take notes on tablets as students introduce themselves. Career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops, and students also use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database, while the university media team captures interviews during these interactions. An aroma of coffee and catered snacks spreads from the lounge, where alumni volunteers share quick pep talks near the coffee station. Workshops on networking etiquette begin in the adjoining classroom. As the day winds down, groups of friends mark target employers on the event map, and interview sign-up sheets fill with names."

Consulting firms display glossy case study booklets on high tables, and some students rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall. Career counselors redirect unsure students toward applicable industries as interview sign-up sheets fill with names, and a whiteboard lists employers offering same-day interviews. Groups of friends mark target employers on the event map, then decompress on the quad, comparing which companies responded warmly. Volunteers stack collapsed booths and collect leftover brochures, while camera crews from the university media team capture interviews. Recruiters remind students to follow up with personalized emails, and a post-event survey link flashes on monitors near the exit. At the entrance, event staff scan registrations and hand out lanyards."
