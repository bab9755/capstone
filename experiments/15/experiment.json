Reconcile & Enhance: If descriptions for the same object differ, merge the details. Use the most specific and complete information from both. Integrate & Spatialize: Combine the complete, de-duplicated set of facts into a single, spatially coherent paragraph. The goal is to describe a larger, combined area. OUTPUT RULES: Format: YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE MUST BE ONLY THE FINAL SYNTHESIZED SUMMARY. Style: Single paragraph of plain text. No markdown, lists, or headings. Objectivity: Be literal, factual, and geometric. Length: Must not exceed 150 words.\n",
