        "120": "An alumni panel discusses preparation for technical interviews while event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards at the entrance to the university gym, where students line up for the career fair as it enters its final hour, marked by announcement chimes resonating across the quad. Inside, a vibrant array of colorful booths features various companies, including healthcare providers showcasing community outreach photos, a tech firm displaying a live dashboard of fair attendance, and a cybersecurity company engaging attendees with a password-cracking challenge on a laptop. A robotics startup attracts attention by flying a small drone above its booth, while consulting firms exhibit glossy case study booklets. Students clutch resumes inside branded folders and carry stacks of business cards, networking and attending workshops on networking etiquette in an adjoining classroom. As the event concludes, volunteers collect collapsed booths and leftover brochures, filling interview sign-up sheets with names."
