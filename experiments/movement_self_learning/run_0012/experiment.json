Tech companies display demo screens showing their latest apps, and a robotics startup features a small drone flying above its booth to attract attention. Concurrently, international students queue for advice on visa sponsorship requirements, indicating concern regarding their future employment opportunities. Career counselors redirect unsure students toward applicable industries and remind attendees to maintain eye contact, while the engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage to support students. Near the exit, a data science company showcases a live dashboard of fair attendance, and a cybersecurity company runs a password cracking challenge on a laptop. Workshops on networking etiquette begin in the adjoining classroom, and a startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session, as some students rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall. As they exit, students carry tote bags and a stack of business cards."
