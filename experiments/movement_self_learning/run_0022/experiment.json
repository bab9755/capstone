        "120": "The dean visits to thank recruiters for their support during an event where students exit the venue with tote bags filled with swag items, including branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, phone chargers, and business cards. Small groups analyze which recruiters appeared most enthusiastic while human resources teams jot notes on tablets during student introductions. An alumni panel discusses preparations for technical interviews, and some students rehearse their elevator pitches against the wall in a quieter area. Alumni volunteers provide quick pep talks near the coffee station, where the aroma of coffee and catered snacks spreads from the lounge. The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage. Finance firms offer QR codes for immediate internship applications, and a robotics startup attracts attention by flying a small drone above its booth. Consulting firms stack glossy case study booklets on high tables, while a whiteboard displays a list of employers scheduling same-day interviews. Concurrently, a cybersecurity company runs a password cracking challenge on a laptop. In the nearby quad, friends decompress and compare which companies responded warmly."
