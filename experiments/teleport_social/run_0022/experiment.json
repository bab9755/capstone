        "120": "At a bustling career fair sponsored by the engineering society in the university gym, numerous booths from diverse organizations, including tech companies, nonprofits, healthcare providers, consulting, and finance firms, attract students with colorful banners. Attendees line up outside before the event opens, clutching resumes in branded folders, while event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards. Inside, career counselors, particularly assisting international students with visa sponsorship inquiries, direct attendees toward relevant industries. A resume review table is located near the stage, where human resources teams document interactions on tablets. A cybersecurity company engages visitors with a password cracking challenge on a laptop, while a robotics startup flies a small drone over its booth. Workshops on networking etiquette are ongoing in an adjoining classroom, and friends decompress on the quad discussing their experiences. The dean expresses gratitude to recruiters during the final hour, within the aroma of coffee and catered snacks filling the lounge."
