Friends decompress on the quad, comparing which companies responded warmly and marking target employers on the event map. Workshops on networking etiquette begin in the adjoining classroom, and a data science company showcases a live dashboard of fair attendance while career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops. Additionally, representatives from nonprofits emphasize mission-driven career paths. Recruiters distribute tote bags filled with branded notebooks and pens."
