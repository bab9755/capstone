Attendees navigate the polished floors, holding resumes in branded folders while engaging with recruiters who distribute tote bags filled with notebooks and pens. Event staff scan registrations, distribute lanyards, and announce the schedule over the PA system. Groups of friends mark target employers on the event map. Outside, some students practice their elevator pitches quietly against the wall and seek guidance on visa sponsorship, while others consult career counselors on networking etiquette. Alumni volunteers provide pep talks near a coffee station with catered snacks. Workshops on networking etiquette and resume reviews occur nearby.

        "118": "The university career fair is a vibrant event held in a gym with a polished floor, showcasing numerous colorful booths adorned with banners from various employers, including tech companies, healthcare providers, consulting firms, nonprofits, finance firms, and a prominent robotics startup demonstrating a small drone flying overhead. As the event progresses toward its final hour, students, including many international attendees, line up outside, some against the wall, rehearsing their elevator pitches while career center staff manage registrations and distribute lanyards at the entrance. Inside, attendees hold resumes in branded folders, while human resources teams log attendance on tablets and assist students in uploading resumes to the fair database at kiosks. The atmosphere features the aroma of coffee and catered snacks in a lounge area, where alumni volunteers provide insights on technical interview preparation and pep talks. As the fair winds down, volunteers begin dismantling booths and students leave with tote bags filled with promotional items, notebooks, pens, and business cards.",
