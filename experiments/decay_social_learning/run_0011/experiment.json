As closing time approaches, marked by announcement chimes, students fill out interview sign-up sheets and exit with tote bags, amid the lingering aroma of coffee and catered snacks."

Inside, dozens of booths with colorful banners surround the polished floor, where students use tablets at kiosks to upload their resumes into the fair database, clutching branded folders and tote bags filled with notebooks, pens, and business cards. Career counselors assist students in identifying applicable industries and provide advice on visa sponsorship requirements. Workshops on networking etiquette and a panel discussing technical interview preparation occur in adjoining classrooms. A robotics startup captures interest with a small drone flying above its booth, while a cybersecurity company hosts a password cracking challenge on a laptop.
