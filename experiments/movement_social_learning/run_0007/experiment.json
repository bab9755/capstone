        "120": "As the career fair progresses, students line up outside the university gym, some rehearsing elevator pitches quietly. Inside, international students seek advice on visa sponsorship requirements at a venue filled with dozens of booths featuring colorful banners circling the polished floor. After receiving guidance, they exit with tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, business cards, and other swag items such as water bottles and phone chargers. Students clutch resumes inside branded folders while the engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage. Alumni volunteers engage in a panel discussion about preparing for technical interviews near the coffee station, where they also share quick pep talks. Small groups analyze which recruiters displayed the most enthusiasm, and representatives from nonprofits emphasize mission-driven career paths. A cybersecurity company runs a password cracking challenge on a laptop, while healthcare providers showcase community outreach photos. Workshops on networking etiquette begin in the adjoining classroom, and the aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the lounge area. A welcome announcement outlines the fair schedule over the PA system, as interview sign-up sheets fill with names and volunteers stack collapsed booths, gathering leftover brochures with monitors displaying a flashing post-event survey link."
