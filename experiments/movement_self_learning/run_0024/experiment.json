The engineering society sponsors a resume review table, and students use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database. Volunteers stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures as interview sign-up sheets fill with names and attendees exit carrying tote bags and a stack of business cards."

        "120": "Camera crews from the university media team are capturing interviews as a data science company showcases a live dashboard displaying fair attendance. Dozens of booths with colorful banners circle the polished floor, where students interact with tech companies displaying demo screens of their latest apps. Friends are decompressing on the quad, comparing their experiences with companies that responded warmly, while groups of friends mark target employers on the event map. Students use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database and hold resumes inside branded folders. An alumni panel discusses how to prepare for technical interviews, and a cybersecurity company conducts a password cracking challenge on a laptop. A startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session. A whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews, and as the day winds down, interview sign-up sheets fill with names. Alumni volunteers share quick pep talks near the coffee station, while some students rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall."
