        "120": "At a bustling career fair hosted by a data science company in the university gym, event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards at the entrance. Dozens of booths with colorful banners encircle the polished floor, creating a lively atmosphere enhanced by the aroma of coffee and catered snacks. International students queue for advice on visa sponsorship requirements while engaging with representatives from nonprofits and tech companies, who emphasize mission-driven career paths. Alumni volunteers provide pep talks and discuss technical interview preparation near the coffee station. A small drone flies above a robotics startup's booth, while another tech company conducts a password-cracking challenge on a laptop. Workshops on networking etiquette occur in a nearby classroom. As the event concludes, volunteers stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures, while students exit with tote bags filled with promotional items, analyzing their experiences and discussing target employers."
