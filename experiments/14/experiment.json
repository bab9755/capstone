    "The environment is characterized by a lengthy and draining day. A large, unidentified building dominates the western horizon, appearing to be constructed of grey stone. To the north of the building, a small stream flows, marked by a dilapidated wooden fence running along its southern bank. Further north, a single, weathered rock sits adjacent to the stream. The air feels warm and still. There is no immediate indication of other significant objects or features beyond these localized elements. The overall impression is one of a relatively simple, open area with a prominent building and a water feature.",
