Event staff at the entrance scan registrations, log attendance metrics on laptops, and distribute lanyards and tote bags filled with branded notebooks and pens. Outside, students gather holding resumes in branded folders, quietly rehearsing their elevator pitches against the wall while seeking advice on visa sponsorship and maintaining eye contact during introductions. Inside, a robotics startup captivates attention with a small flying drone, while a nearby cybersecurity company hosts a password cracking challenge on a laptop. Human resources teams take notes on tablets as students introduce themselves. Alumni volunteers offer pep talks near the coffee station, accompanied by the aroma of coffee and catered snacks. As the fair concludes, announcement chimes signal the final hour, and students exit carrying stacks of business cards and tote bags, with monitors near the exit displaying a post-event survey link."

Human resources teams take notes on tablets during student introductions, while the engineering society sponsors a resume review table near a coffee station, where the aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the air. Alumni volunteers provide pep talks, and as the fair concludes, students exit carrying stacks of business cards, reflecting on which recruiters seemed most enthusiastic."
