International students queue for advice on visa sponsorship requirements. A welcome announcement outlines the fair schedule over the PA system, and a live dashboard displays attendance data. Tech companies showcase demos, with a robotics startup flying a small drone and a cybersecurity firm running an interactive password cracking challenge. Recruiters distribute tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, and phone chargers, encouraging students to follow up with personalized emails. Students also use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database. As the day winds down, interview sign-up sheets fill, and volunteers stack collapsed booths."
