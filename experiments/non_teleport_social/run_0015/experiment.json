        "120": "The university gym is bustling with a vibrant atmosphere during a live career fair organized by a data science company, featuring dozens of colorful booths from tech firms, healthcare providers, consulting firms, and cybersecurity companies. Students eagerly line up outside before the event opens and later gather to discuss their experiences, holding resumes in branded folders. Recruiters distribute tote bags filled with notebooks and pens, while a cybersecurity company engages attendees with a password cracking challenge, and an engineering society sponsors a resume review table. Human resources teams jot notes on tablets as they interact with students, and career counselors direct those unsure about applicable industries. Networking etiquette workshops and an alumni panel on technical interview preparation take place in an adjoining classroom. Announcement chimes signal the end of the event, as attendees compare swag items and leave with tote bags, business cards, and insights about employer responses."
