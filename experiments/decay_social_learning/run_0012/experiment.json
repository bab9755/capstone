Numerous colorful booths showcase various companies, including a cybersecurity firm conducting a password cracking challenge on a laptop and a robotics startup flying a small drone above its booth. Students, including some international attendees, actively introduce themselves to human resources teams while carrying tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, business cards, and resumes in branded folders. They use tablets at kiosks to upload their information to the career center's database and fill out interview sign-up sheets. Concurrent workshops on networking etiquette, led by career counselors, take place in an adjoining classroom, where students rehearse elevator pitches and seek advice on visa sponsorship. As the day winds down, volunteers begin to tidy up, collapsing booths and gathering leftover brochures, while the aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the air.",
