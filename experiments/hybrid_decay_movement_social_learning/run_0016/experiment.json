        "120": "The university career fair is a vibrant event taking place in a polished gym, surrounded by colorful booths from various employers, including a robotics startup featuring a small drone flying above its booth, consulting firms, healthcare providers, and a cybersecurity firm conducting a password cracking challenge. Students, including international attendees, line up outside with resumes in branded folders, eager to engage with recruiters. Inside, dozens of booths encircle the floor as event staff manage logistics on laptops, scanning registrations and distributing tote bags filled with promotional materials like notebooks, pens, and water bottles. Career counselors offer guidance, and alumni volunteers encourage attendees while human resources teams take notes on tablets and provide advice on visa sponsorship. As the final hour approaches, announcement chimes signal the impending conclusion, with students exiting carrying packed tote bags and business cards while support staff begin clearing away booths."
