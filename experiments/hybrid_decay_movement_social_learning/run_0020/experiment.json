Inside, students utilize tablets at kiosks to upload their resumes, while human resources teams jot notes on tablets and analyze recruiters' enthusiasm. Event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards at the entrance, and recruiters hand out tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, and phone chargers. Alumni volunteers offer pep talks, discuss interactions with recruiters near a coffee station, and lead workshops on networking etiquette in an adjoining classroom. As the event concludes, monitors display a post-event survey link while volunteers stack booths and gather leftover brochures, with interview sign-up sheets filling with names."

Students actively upload resumes at kiosks, supported by a resume review table from the engineering society. As the fair concludes, interview sign-up sheets fill quickly, and monitors display a post-event survey link near the exit. Workshops on networking etiquette and preparing for technical interviews occur in an adjoining classroom."
