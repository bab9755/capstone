Event staff scanned registrations and distributed lanyards at the entrance. Inside, various tech companies showcased their latest apps on demo screens, with a robotics startup attracting attention by flying a small drone above its booth and a cybersecurity company conducting a password-cracking challenge. Workshops on networking etiquette and technical interview preparation took place in an adjoining classroom, featuring career counselors and an alumni panel. Students uploaded their resumes at kiosks, compared swag items like tote bags filled with notebooks, pens, and water bottles, and signed up for interviews listed on a whiteboard. As the event concluded, volunteers organized booths and managed cleanup, while camera crews captured the day’s activities."
