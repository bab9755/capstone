    "The university’s main hall is a bustling environment centered around student career transitions. Numerous students and recruiters are actively engaged in career planning and networking activities, with representatives from TechSolutions, Global Dynamics, and various startup sectors present. TechSolutions occupies a table staffed with a recruiter wearing a bright red tie and a coffee machine dispensing black coffee. Global Dynamics features a booth where a recruiter interacts with students, displaying company data on a tablet and a small potted plant on the counter. Ongoing career and interview skills workshops, including mock interviews and informational panels, are taking place alongside students examining resumes, rehearsing elevator pitches, and collecting branded tote bags while exchanging business cards and engaging in networking. Multiple workstations with computers and a large whiteboard filled with student notes are also located within the hall."
