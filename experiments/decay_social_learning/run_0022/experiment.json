Staff scanned registrations and distributed lanyards and tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, and snacks, creating a welcoming atmosphere enhanced by the aroma of coffee and catered refreshments. Inside, vibrant booths displayed banners from healthcare providers, consulting firms, and tech companies, including a robotics startup showcasing a small drone.
