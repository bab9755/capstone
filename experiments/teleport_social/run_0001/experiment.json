Students utilize tablets at kiosks to upload their resumes to the fair database while some quietly rehearse elevator pitches against the wall. Career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops, and international students queue for advice on visa sponsorship requirements. Nearby, alumni volunteers give pep talks, an alumni panel discusses preparations for technical interviews, and workshops on networking etiquette take place in an adjoining classroom. As the day winds down, students exit while filling out interview sign-up sheets, and a post-event survey link appears on monitors near the exit."

Recruiters from finance and a data science company provide QR codes for immediate internship applications, reminding students to follow up with personalized emails. Students leave with tote bags filled with branded items such as notebooks, pens, water bottles, and business cards, discussing which recruiters seemed most enthusiastic. The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage, and alumni volunteers offer quick pep talks. Workshops on networking etiquette begin in an adjoining classroom, alongside an alumni panel discussing preparations for technical interviews. Healthcare providers showcase community outreach photos, and students use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database."

As the final hour approaches, announcement chimes signal the event's end, prompting students to exit while interview sign-up sheets fill and a post-event survey link appears on monitors near the exit."
