Recruiters and event staff manage registrations, distributing tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, water bottles, phone chargers, and business cards, and announcing the fair schedule over the PA system. Attendees, primarily students, interact with recruiters and receive guidance from career counselors, while some rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall. Workshops on networking etiquette and technical interview preparation take place in nearby classrooms. Interactive challenges, such as a cybersecurity password cracking contest and a drone demonstration by a robotics startup, engage participants. As the event concludes with announcement chimes, students leave with tote bags and stacks of business cards, while a whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews. Monitors near the exit display a post-event survey link.",
