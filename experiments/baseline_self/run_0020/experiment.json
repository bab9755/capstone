A lunchtime pitch session is hosted by a startup founder, and the dean expresses gratitude to recruiters for their support. The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage, while various tech companies showcase their latest apps on demo screens. A robotics startup garners attention with a small drone flying above its booth, and consulting firms display glossy case study booklets on elevated tables. Representatives from nonprofits highlight mission-driven career paths, and healthcare providers showcase community outreach photos, as university media teams capture interviews. Additionally, alumni volunteers share quick pep talks near the coffee station. Career counselors advise attendees to maintain eye contact, and human resources teams take notes on tablets as students introduce themselves. As the day winds down, interview sign-up sheets fill with names, international students queue for advice on visa sponsorship requirements, and attendees leave with tote bags and a stack of business cards."
