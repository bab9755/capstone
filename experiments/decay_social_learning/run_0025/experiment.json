Students lined up outside, clutching resumes in branded folders and rehearsing elevator pitches against the wall. Inside, career counselors provided industry guidance and visa sponsorship assistance, while alumni volunteers offered pep talks near the coffee station. Workshops on networking etiquette, sponsored by the engineering society, took place in an adjoining classroom alongside a lunchtime pitch session hosted by a startup founder. A cybersecurity company hosted a password cracking challenge, and a data science company showcased a live dashboard. As the fair concluded, event staff logged attendance metrics, and volunteers stacked collapsed booths and gathered leftover brochures, with students decompressing outside and discussing their experiences with recruiters."
