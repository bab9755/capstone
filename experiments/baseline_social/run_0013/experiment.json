        "120": "A vibrant career center event unfolds in the university gym, where students eagerly line up outside holding resumes in branded folders and tote bags filled with notebooks and pens. Upon entering, event staff scan registrations, distribute lanyards, and log attendance metrics on laptops and tablets. Inside, colorful booths encircle the polished floor featuring a robotics startup showcasing a small drone flying above its booth, a cybersecurity firm running a password-cracking challenge, and various tech companies displaying demo screens of their latest apps. Career counselors assist students, particularly international students, with industry recommendations and visa sponsorship advice. Workshops on networking etiquette and an alumni panel on technical interview preparation occur in an adjoining classroom. The aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the air, and as the final hour approaches, announcement chimes signal wrap-up preparations. Students exit with tote bags and stacks of business cards after engaging with recruiters and refining their elevator pitches."
