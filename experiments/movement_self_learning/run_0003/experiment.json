A data science company showcases a live dashboard tracking attendance metrics logged by career center staff on laptops, while a cybersecurity company runs a password cracking challenge on another laptop. Tech companies display demo screens showing their latest apps, and students compare various swag items, including water bottles and phone chargers, as recruiters hand out tote bags containing branded notebooks and pens. Consulting firms stack glossy case study booklets on high tables, and finance firms offer QR codes for immediate internship applications. Students use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database. An announcement detailing the fair schedule is broadcast over the PA system, and a whiteboard lists employers offering same-day interviews. Additionally, a startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session, while alumni volunteers share pep talks near the coffee station and friends decompress on the quad, discussing company responses.
