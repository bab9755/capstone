The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage, and a whiteboard lists employers scheduling same-day interviews, with sign-up sheets filling as the day progresses. As the day winds down, these interview sign-up sheets continue to fill with names. Consulting firms stack glossy case study booklets on high tables, and a data science company showcases a live dashboard of fair attendance. Alumni volunteers offer quick pep talks near the coffee station. In the vicinity, a robotics startup attracts attention by flying a small drone above its booth, and tech companies showcase their latest apps on demo screens. Small groups analyze which recruiters seemed most enthusiastic, while career counselors guide unsure students toward relevant industries. Additionally, a startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session, while friends decompress on the quad, comparing which companies responded warmly."
