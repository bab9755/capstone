        "120": "At the recruiting event at the university gym, students line up outside, clutching resumes inside branded folders while human resources teams take notes on tablets. Event staff scan registrations and hand out lanyards at the entrance, and students use kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database. Recruiters distribute tote bags filled with notebooks and pens, encouraging follow-up with personalized emails. Consulting firms showcase glossy case study booklets on high tables, and a startup founder invites students to a lunchtime pitch session. Tech companies display demo screens showing their latest apps, and the aroma of coffee and catered snacks fills the lounge. Near the stage, the engineering society sponsors a resume review table where students introduce themselves, while some rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall. Career counselors assist unsure students by redirecting them toward applicable industries, and alumni volunteers share quick pep talks near the coffee station.
