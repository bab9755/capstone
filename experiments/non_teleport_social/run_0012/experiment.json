        "120": "During the final hour of a career center event held in the university gym, announcement chimes signal its approach as students line up outside before entering. Inside, dozens of booths with colorful banners encircle the polished floor, showcasing demo screens for tech companies' latest apps, community outreach photos from healthcare providers, and a cybersecurity company hosting a password-cracking challenge on a laptop. Consulting firms have stacked glossy case study booklets on high tables. Students, clutching resumes inside branded folders, use tablets at kiosks to upload their resumes to the fair database. The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage, while representatives from nonprofits emphasize mission-driven career paths, and career counselors guide unsure students toward suitable industries, including providing advice on visa sponsorship for international students. Students attend networking etiquette workshops in an adjoining classroom, and alumni volunteers offer pep talks on preparation for technical interviews. As the event winds down, camera crews capture interviews, and volunteers stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures while beginning to pack up."

The polished floor is surrounded by booths featuring colored banners from healthcare providers displaying community outreach photos, a robotics startup with a small flying drone, and a cybersecurity company running a password-cracking challenge. A data science company showcases a live dashboard of fair attendance, and students rehearse elevator pitches near the wall. Workshops on networking etiquette and an alumni panel discussing technical interviews occur in an adjoining classroom, where alumni volunteers provide pep talks.
