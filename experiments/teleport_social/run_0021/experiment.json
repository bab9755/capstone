        "120": "Before the career fair opens, students line up outside the university gym where event staff scan registrations and distribute lanyards. Inside, numerous booths adorned with colorful banners encircle the polished floor, featuring recruiters from various industries, including finance and a robotics startup with a small drone flying above its booth. Recruiters engage in conversations with students, jotting notes on tablets, while students introduce themselves. Career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops, and an announcement outlining the fair schedule is broadcast over the PA system. As the fair nears its final hour, announcement chimes prompt students to exit, many carrying tote bags filled with branded notebooks, pens, and stacks of business cards. Some students quietly rehearse their elevator pitches against the wall, and career counselors guide others toward applicable industries, sponsoring a resume review table near the stage. Interview sign-up sheets fill as the day winds down, with recruiters emphasizing personalized follow-up emails and offering same-day interviews."
