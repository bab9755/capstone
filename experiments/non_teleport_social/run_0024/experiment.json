Students also use tablets at kiosks to upload resumes to the fair database. The engineering society sponsors a resume review table near the stage, and monitors near the exit flash a post-event survey link as volunteers stack collapsed booths and gather leftover brochures, fostering an atmosphere of engagement and opportunity throughout the day."
