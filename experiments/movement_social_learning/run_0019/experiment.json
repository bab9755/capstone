Event staff scan registrations and hand out lanyards at the entrance, while international students queue outside for visa sponsorship advice before the event opens. Inside, students engage with enthusiastic recruiters, and some rehearse elevator pitches quietly against the wall. Career center staff log attendance metrics on laptops, and volunteers assist at a resume review table sponsored by the engineering society. Attendees can explore booths with demo screens showcasing various apps and materials such as case study booklets and utilize kiosks for resume uploads. Groups of friends mark target employers on the event map, and an alumni panel discusses technical interview preparation. As the day concludes, students exit with tote bags filled with notebooks, pens, and a stack of business cards, while volunteers gather leftover brochures as announcement chimes signal the final hour."
